# Enhancing Language Model Generation through Vector Database Augmentation

## Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach to neural text generation that combines traditional language model generation with nearest-neighbor lookups in a vector database. By averaging hidden state representations from similar contexts stored in Pinecone, we demonstrate modest improvements in both perplexity and BLEU scores compared to standard autoregressive generation.

## 1. Introduction
Large language models typically generate text by applying a learned linear transformation (the "language model head") to the hidden states produced by their transformer layers. While effective, this approach relies solely on the model's learned parameters and doesn't leverage external knowledge that might be available at inference time.

## 2. Method
Our approach augments the traditional generation process by:

1. Computing hidden states for the current context using a pre-trained language model
2. Querying a vector database (Pinecone) to find similar hidden states from previous generations
3. Averaging the retrieved vectors to create an enhanced representation
4. Using this averaged representation as input to the language model head

The key innovation is the integration of retrieval-augmented generation at the hidden state level, rather than at the token or embedding level.
