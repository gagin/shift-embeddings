# Enhancing Language Model Generation through Vector Database Augmentation

## Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach to neural text generation that combines traditional language model generation with nearest-neighbor lookups in a vector database. By averaging hidden state representations from similar contexts stored in Pinecone, we demonstrate modest improvements in both perplexity and BLEU scores compared to standard autoregressive generation.

## 1. Introduction
Large language models typically generate text by applying a learned linear transformation (the "language model head") to the hidden states produced by their transformer layers. While effective, this approach relies solely on the model's learned parameters and doesn't leverage external knowledge that might be available at inference time.

## 2. Method
Our approach augments the traditional generation process by:

1. Computing hidden states for the current context using a pre-trained language model
2. Querying a vector database (Pinecone) to find similar hidden states from previous generations
3. Averaging the retrieved vectors to create an enhanced representation
4. Using this averaged representation as input to the language model head

The key innovation is the integration of retrieval-augmented generation at the hidden state level, rather than at the token or embedding level.

## 3. Experimental Setup
We evaluated our method using:
- Base Model: TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0
- Vector Database: Pinecone
- Test Set: A collection of prompts with known good continuations
- Metrics: Log probability and BLEU scores

## 4. Results
Our method showed modest but consistent improvements over the baseline:

| Method | Log Probability | BLEU Score |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Classic | -18.907 | 0.260 |
| Pinecone | -18.600 | 0.293 |

The improved log probabilities suggest that the vector-augmented approach produces more confident predictions, while higher BLEU scores indicate better alignment with reference texts.

## 5. Discussion
The results demonstrate that incorporating information from similar hidden states can improve generation quality. This suggests that the method successfully leverages contextual information stored in the vector database to guide the generation process.

### Advantages:
- No fine-tuning required
- Can be updated dynamically by adding vectors to the database
- Maintains the base model's general capabilities while incorporating specific knowledge

### Limitations:
- Additional latency from vector database queries
- Requires maintaining a vector database
- Improvements are modest rather than transformative

## 6. Future Work
Several directions for future research emerge:
1. Exploring different averaging strategies for neighbor vectors
2. Investigating the optimal number of neighbors to consider
3. Testing with larger language models
4. Developing methods to curate the vector database for optimal retrieval

## 7. Conclusion
We presented a novel approach to neural text generation that combines traditional language modeling with vector database retrieval. While improvements are modest, the method shows promise for applications where external knowledge integration is valuable.
